What is NeSy?
======
Neuro-Symbolic/Neurosymbolic/Neural-Symbolic.

A NeSy system is a neural network constructed from a data base (D) and
a knowledge base (K). This is to combine the powers of learning
and reasoning to offer robust capability to make decisions under
uncertainty. The advantages of NeSy can be:

- Transparency/Intepretability: 
- Problem solving: Solve harder and more complex problems.
- Robustness: Ability to deal with changing situation and adversarial attacks.

These are among the research topics that NeSy researchers (including me) are investigating.
