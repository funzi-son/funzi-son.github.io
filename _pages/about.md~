I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of Tasmania, Australia. Before that, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science (2016) from City, University of London, an EU Erasmus Mundus joint MSc in Networks and e-Business Computing, University of Reading, and a BSc in Electronic Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I am interested in neural computing, including neural-symbolic computing, deep neural networks, and their applications in signal processsing.
