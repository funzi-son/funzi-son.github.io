I am a Senior Lecturer at Deakin University, Australia. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science (2016) from City, University of London. I am interested in neural computing and its advantages in making sense from data. My current focus is on neural-symbolic computing for robust, transparent AI, and Human-AI teaming. I am also interested in applications of (deep) neural networks in Health Care, Agriculture, and Autonomous Systems.
