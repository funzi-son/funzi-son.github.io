abstract: 'Neural-symbolic  systems  combine  the  strengths  of  neuralnetworks  and  symbolic  formalisms.   In  this  paper,  we  in-troduce a neural-symbolic system which combines restrictedBoltzmann  machines  and  probabilistic  semi-abstract  argu-mentation.   We  propose  to  train  networks  on  argument  la-bellings  explaining  the  data,  so  that  any  sampled  data  out-come is associated with an argument labelling. Argument la-bellings are integrated as constraints within restricted Boltz-mann machines, so that the neural networks are used to learnprobabilistic dependencies amongst argument labels.  Givena dataset and an argumentation graph as prior knowledge, forevery example/caseKin the dataset, we use a so-calledK-maxconsistent labelling of the graph, and an explanation ofcaseKrefers to aK-maxconsistent labelling of the given ar-gumentation graph.  The abilities of the proposed system topredict correct labellings were evaluated and compared withstandard machine learning techniques. Experiments revealedthat such argumentation Boltzmann machines can outperformother classification models, especially in noisy settings'
